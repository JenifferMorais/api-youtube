No inicio pensei que o curso poderia não ser mais válido em função de ser um pouco antigo- mas a cada evolução de cada modulo e exercírcios vem surpeendendo. Eu  programo a anos no paradigma da linguagem estruturada- e já havia feitos vários ensaios de pular pro lado do OO- e já havia assistido varias outros vídeos curtos e outros longos- mas até então minha cabeça não havia aberto para assimilar da forma como está sendo com o seu curso. Estou ansioso agora pra terminar este- concluindo todas as etapas que tem sido de grande valia- pra iniciar os seus outros cursos. Parabéns pela didática- conteúdo programático- metodologia- organização.

Assisto 3 a 4 vezes o mesmo vídeo e anoto pra fixar o aprendizado- você tem uma didática sensacional- eu nunca aprendi tanto!Seu conteúdo vai além de qualquer curso que eu já tenha feito- você passa serenidade e muita clareza- eu realmente custo a acreditar que esse conteúdo é gratuito.Farei todos os cursos do canal- e quando houver alguma palestra terei o prazer de ir prestigia-loEstou esperançoso que consiga conhecer uma nova área de t.i com o conhecimento obtido em suas aulasUm forte abraço desse pequeno gafanhoto!,305954,18000,37,1,703,0,1,0,2,3,0.22125,0.6774305555555555,0.15,0.0,0.0,0.5420138888888889,1

Quanto ao resultado da exibição do site nos navegadores que tenho está perfeito. Porém- na interface demo do dreamweaver (design- e live) está completamente diferente de como aparece no navegador. Se isso aconteceu com alguém eu agradeço que compartilhem. Obrigado!,305954,18000,37,0,384,0,1,0,2,3,0.0,0.7425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7425,1

Tenho quase certeza de que é um byte- porque um char ocupa 1 espaço de memória- e contem 256 combinações- sendo impossível armazenar em 1 bit. 2^8 é exatamente 256- ou seja as 2 possibilidades (0-1) elevado a 8 (que é o numero de bits que contem em um byte).,245745,8300,62,0,209,0,1,0,1,2,0.15,0.3875,0.15,0.0,0.0,525,1

Aos 4':44'' você afirma que uma variável int ocupa 4 bits na memória ( e até colore as células 12-15)- mas nas literaturas dizem que essa variável ocupa 32 bits- ou seja- 4 bytes e não 4 bits.

No inicio pensei que o curso poderia não ser mais válido em função de ser um pouco antigo- mas a cada evolução de cada modulo e exercírcios vem surpeendendo. Eu  programo a anos no paradigma da linguagem estruturada- e já havia feitos vários ensaios de pular pro lado do OO- e já havia assistido varias outros vídeos curtos e outros longos- mas até então minha cabeça não havia aberto para assimilar da forma como está sendo com o seu curso. Estou ansioso agora pra terminar este- concluindo todas as etapas que tem sido de grande valia- pra iniciar os seus outros cursos. Parabéns pela didática- conteúdo programático- metodologia- organização.

Caro professor Guanabara-Primeiramente gostaria de parabenizá-lo pelo projeto e dedicação do Curso em Vídeo. Porém- gostaria de deixar uma opinião.Sempre pensei que HTML5 era coisa do outro mundo- mas assistindo e praticando as aulas vi que a princípio é bem fácil de entender essa linguagem junto com o CSS3.Fazendo os outros cursos (Algoritmo- PHP- MySQL- Java e POO) percebi que não é tão simples como parece. O que acontece é que aprendemos apenas usar as operações matemáticas e como fechar a média de um aluno e mostrar qual foi o melhor da classe. Penso que programação é um mundo mais extenso- então aqui fica a minha pergunta: não seria melhor você mostrar nos vídeos como criar- por exemplo- um aplicativo em Java igual o que você fez do curso em vídeo e mostrou no seu smartphone? Acho que fica de acordo com a realidade- pois não tenho nem ideia do que fazer para começar a criar um sistema/aplicativo. Penso que praticando como criar um software- telas de inicialização- criando um instalador- etc- ficaria mais simples de entender as linhas de código. Já que todos os programadores que conheço dizem que não é nada fácil.Desde já antecipo meus agradecimentos-Abraço!,144008,7600,15,84,983,0,1,0,3,2,0.0,0.47578125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47578125,1

Penso que programação é um mundo mais extenso- então aqui fica a minha pergunta: não seria melhor você mostrar nos vídeos como criar- por exemplo- um aplicativo em Java igual o que você fez do curso em vídeo e mostrou no seu smartphone? Acho que fica de acordo com a realidade- pois não tenho nem ideia do que fazer para começar a criar um sistema/aplicativo. Penso que praticando como criar um software- telas de inicialização- criando um instalador- etc- ficaria mais simples de entender as linhas de código. Já que todos os programadores que conheço dizem que não é nada fácil.Desde já antecipo meus agradecimentos-Abraço!,144008,7600,15,84,983,0,1,0,4,3,0.0,0.47578125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47578125,1

A lógica de programação OO está excelente. Só vou fazer uma observação sobre o conceito de herança- o reúso de código é uma consequência- o mais importante na herança é definir subtipos- no exemplo- aluno e professor são especializações do tipo pessoa. Os conceitos de generalização e especialização vão esclarecer de vez o uso de herança na OO.Parabéns pela didática e conteúdo !!,144008,7600,15,1,319,0,1,0,3,2,0.0,0.745625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.745625,1

A leitura que fiz defor l in range(0- 3):for c in range(0- 3):é a seguinte: PARA CADA LINHA HAVERÁ 3 COLUNAS.Eu vou substituir por outros números para ficar mais claro.for l in range(0- 4):for c in range(0- 6):PARA CADA linha (que serão 4) haverá 6 colunasResultado1      2      3      4      5      67      8      9     10    11   1213  14    15    16    17   1819  20    21    22    23   24,170446,8000,51,66,368,0,1,0,3,2,525,0.46958333333333335,0.0,175,175,-0.05541666666666667,0

Eu achei mais intuitivo colocar o primeiro for como coluna e o segundo como linha. Se persarmos que o programa sempre digita os valores na vertical- então faz sentido manter a coluna a cada laço de linha- ou seja- só alterando as linhas. Do jeito que tá no exercício- o raciocínio acaba invertido- mas dá no mesmo. Só consegui pensar assim depois da resolução. Antes eu fiz 3 listas compostas e 1 laço for pra cada um kkkkkkmatriz = [[]- []- []]for coluna in range(0- 3):for linha in range(0- 3):matriz[linha].append(int(input(f'Digite um valor para {[linha- coluna]}: ')))print('-='*50)# Serve para visualizar o comportamento para a posterior transformação.

Acho que a solução poderia alterar os valores para a posição de um elemento em uma matriz.Os elementos de uma matriz possuem a notação do tipo X linha- coluna- o valor para [0-0] seria [1-1]....

"Todo final de ano ocorre uma festa na escola. As inscrições para participar da festa são abertas no início de julho. No momento da inscrição- o aluno pode escolher se quer ser ""O Amigo do Pablo"" na festa ou não. O mais lógico seria escolher a opção Sim- afinal- é um privilégio ser O Amigo do Pablo- já que ele é a pessoa mais descolada da escola. Porém- há indivíduos que definitivamente não pretendem ser O Amigo do Pablo- e por motivos desconhecidos.Somente um será o escolhido. Em vista disso- muitos alunos que escolheram a opção Sim realizaram a inscrição diversas vezes para aumentar a própria probabilidade de ser O Amigo do Pablo. A diretora da escola pediu que você desenvolva um programa que organize as inscrições do site- pois está havendo um spam de inscrições. O critério para ser o escolhido é a quantidade de letras do primeiro nome- e em caso de empate- vence aquele que realizou primeiro a inscrição. A organização final dos inscritos deverá seguir a ordem de escolha (Sim ou Não)- mas respeitando a ordem alfabética.OBS.: Ninguém que escolheu a opção Não realizou a inscrição mais de uma vez.EntradaA entrada contém somente um caso de teste. Cada linha é composta pelo primeiro nome do participante (sem espaços)- seguido da opção SIM (caso o usuário queira ser O Amigo do Pablo) ou NAO (caso não queira). A entrada termina assim que o usuário digita ""FIM"" (sem as aspas).SaídaSeu programa deverá imprimir os inscritos pela ordem de escolha e por ordem alfabética- seguido do nome do vencedor.

Seria interessante se você fizesse uma aula de pilha e ou fila sem que usasse a biblioteca stack- isso iria ajudar tambem a galera- pricnpalmente com a tua ótima didática a galera ia  assimilar muito melhor tambem.,42023,2500,14,0,211,0,1,0,3,3,0.0,0.5578125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5578125,1
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Uma outra maneira legal de entender pilhas- e que aprendi na faculade- é o exemplo dos livros: vamos largando um em cima do outro- e para retirar o mais ao fundo- precisamos começar do topo.,42023,2500,14,0,156,0,1,0,2,2,145,0.6458333333333334,145,0.0,145,0.4041666666666667,0

Muito bom o vídeo professor.Eu vou ter prova daqui a duas semanas de estrutura de dados em C/C++. Infelizmente o professor na minha faculdade não ensinou desta forma- inclusive ele não gosta que utilizemos métodos rsrs- mais em fim- estou tendo a maior dificuldade nessa matéria porque ele está usando pilha e fila utilizando heap- onde é preciso criar um ponteiro- e manipular os dados pelo ponteiro- eu acho super complicado- uma sintaxe bem esquisita. Pra mim que vem do C# onde tem Gabarge Collector e não preciso me preocupar  com essa coisa de desalocar memória é mais difícil- mais infelizmente tenho que passar por esta matéria- inclusive to quase terminando a faculdade- mais estou devendo algumas matérias- incluindo essa.,42023,2500,14,0,612,0,1,0,2,2,0.39166666666666666,1.0,0.30520833333333336,0.43645833333333334,0.21770833333333334,0.240625,0

"Só completando- em- pois ficou um pouco obscura a explicação. Os ponteiros tem um tipo especial. Um ponteiro é do tipo ""ponteiro""- que é só um número de endereço como foi explicado no vídeo. Em C++- por exemplo- é muito comum atribuir o valor 0 quando se deseja que um ponteiro aponte para o vazio.O tipo é necessário na declaração para efetuar o cálculo de endereço na hora que o ponteiro for ""dereferenced"" (não sei como fala em português)- ou seja- utilizado o operador *. Quando você utiliza a expressão (*p) e o tipo referenciado por p é um tipo de 8 bits (char- por exemplo)- o compilador sabe que deve fazer a leitura de 8 bits a partir do endereço de memória de p- sem medo de recuperar informações de forma errada.Ótimos vídeos- parabéns!",94008,3200,73,22,613,0,1,0,2,2,0.3809895833333333,0.45664930555555555,0.0,0.3809895833333333,0.0,0.28111458333333333,0

"Seria muito melhor explicar o conceito usando - por exemplo. o gdb (ou algum depurador semelhante). No gdb- por exemplo- vc poderia parar em uma linha especifica- chamar a memória para mostrar os valores direto nela- executar a linha e mostrar o que aconteceu ""diretamente"" na memória- seria ainda mais claro o que o ponteiro significa e como ele realmente funciona na prática. Vc não explicou- por exemplo- que a variável como ponteiro- independente do tipo- sempre vai ser do tipo que carrega o endereço de memória (não importa se o ponteiro é do tipo char- short int e afins- ele SEMPRE  terá o tamanho para armazenar em sí o endereço de memória- que é geralmente do tipo int ou 4 bytes)- o que muda no ponteiro é que ele vai ler a quantidade de dados do tamanho do tipo que vc definiu (aí sim- vc tem o ponteiro em sí que tem 4 bytes- mas supondo que é um ponteiro tipo char- ele aponta para a memória e lê apenas 1 byte ao invés de 4bytes).

Oi!! A melhor explicacao que já encontrei. Voce poderia me sanar uma duvida? Entao- quando declaramos uma variavel identificamos o tipo. Por exemplo o char sabemos que possui 1byte e que tem intervalo de -127 a 128. A duvida é: Como usar um ponteiro para apontar para os intervalos negativos? Ou somente aponto para o intervalo de 0 a 255?,94008,3200,73,1,280,0,1,0,2,2,205,415,0.21,0.0,205,0.42,0
